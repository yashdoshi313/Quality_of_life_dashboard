# Canada Quality of Life Analysis Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes socio-economic and quality-of-life metrics in Canada using Power BI and Statistics Canada data. It provides insights into discrimination trends, employment rates, life satisfaction, waste management, and the sense of belonging across Canadian provinces. 

## Objectives
- To evaluate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19.
- To understand regional disparities in life satisfaction, employment, and environmental sustainability.
- To provide policymakers and stakeholders with actionable insights based on data trends.

## Key Features
1. **Discrimination Stats Pre & Post COVID-19**
   - Examines changes in discrimination based on ethnicity, culture, and workplace dynamics.
   - Metrics show a significant decrease in ethnic and cultural discrimination (-51.61%) post-COVID.

2. **Employment Rate for October**
   - Breaks down employment statistics by age group, full-time/part-time status, and month-over-month/year-over-year changes.

3. **Life Satisfaction Metrics (2021–2024)**
   - Tracks satisfaction levels by province, gender, and time.
   - Shows a declining satisfaction trend across genders and regions.

4. **Canada's Performance as per QoL**
   - Visualizes changes in racism post-COVID, waste management trends, and sense of belonging indicators.

5. **Sense of Belonging in 2024**
   - Highlights regional and gender-based variations in belonging sentiments.

6. **Waste Management by Province**
   - Analyzes waste disposal trends (2014–2022) across provinces, focusing on residential and non-residential waste.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Power BI** for dashboard creation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for custom calculations.
- **Statistics Canada datasets** for reliable data inputs.

## Challenges
- Addressing data inconsistencies and missing information.
- Interpreting complex multidimensional issues, such as causality between metrics.
- Presenting data-driven insights for public engagement and policy recommendations.

## Results
- Declines in workplace and cultural discrimination post-COVID.
- Steady growth in employment rates but disparities across demographics.
- Regional differences in waste management practices and life satisfaction.
